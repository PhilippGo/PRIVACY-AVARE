Current functions that are needed to handle the settings of apps: 

    1) add App
    2) update App - could be splittet into multiple functions (updateFilter, updateStatus ... )
    3) remove App

To be discussed: Should we load and upload the complete store to the server (since it only saves one file) or should we offer functions to just load and uploads the app array? 

    5) load Apps
    6) upload Apps
