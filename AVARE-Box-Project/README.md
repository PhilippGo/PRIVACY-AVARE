AVARE BOX PROJECT
-----------

## Introduction 

This sandboxing and hooking framework is based on the GitHub project VirtualApp [https://github.com/asLody/VirtualApp]. Based on the branch of a fork [https://github.com/rk700/VirtualHook/tree/fca5dcbc37b3e3d39cff62e59134b5544a4d4261] as of 21.08.2017 [Commit fca5dcbc37b3e3d39cff62e59134b5544a4d4261] and on the main project [https://github.com/asLody/VirtualApp] as of 29.10.2017 [Commit fd29f19410caaf5606060bc941a19299723b550970]. These versions are licensed by the authors under GNU General Public License Version 3 (GPLv3) [Source: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html]. Newer versions of VirtualApp and VirtualHook no longer have this license information. For the purpose of the AVARE project, the branch of the fork and the main project were merged independently and any conflicts arising in the process were resolved by us. Additionally we have updated the YAHFA Framework [https://github.com/rk700/YAHFA] in the project to the state of 03.07.2018 [Commit b57672dbd95ca6d78d1d56badb5c60322c4d0807]. The current YAHFA framework is also licensed under GPLv3.

The package identifiers have been renamed to fit the new project context.

Additionally, a plugin based on the YAHFA demo plugin for filtering contacts is already included (package app.avare.plugin.contactsfilterplugin).
